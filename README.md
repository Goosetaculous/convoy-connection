# convoy-connection
The best convoy app EVAH

High Level

 Convoy-connection is a restaurant search app that displays the following:
 
 1.  Yelp review
 2.  Location on the map
 3.  Trip Advisor review
 
 The user should also be able to pick  a pin on the map instead of putting it on the textbox.  Also this is strictly convoy so it should only show Convoy restaurants. Then displays the results. What would be nice is if we can compare the ratings ( each api)
